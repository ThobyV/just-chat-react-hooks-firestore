## :smiley_cat: JustChat - A Real-Time messaging web application built using React Hooks API and Firestore Database SDKs. 

> Warning! Please try not to use this Project in Production. Apart from being buggy, not too optimized.. Firestore database billing structure does not really fit an app like this. Its adviceable to Use The Real-time Database instead for serious real time apps as it has best billing method that fits this. This is mostly experimental just to cruise Firestore's awesome querying/real time features. Thanks!
