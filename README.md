## :smiley_cat: JustChat - A Real-Time messaging web application bauilt using React Hooks API and Firestore Database SDKs. 

> Warning! Please try not to use this Project in Production. Apart from being buggy, not too optimized.. Firestore database billing structure does not really fit an app like this. Its adviceable to Use Firebase Database instead for serious real time apps as it has best support (billing/API) for this. This is mostly experimental just to cruise Firestore's real time features. Thanks!
